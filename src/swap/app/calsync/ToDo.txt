How to properly design your app
keeping things separate
Async architecture

First used service but then AlarmManager

To Do tasks-

Error handling - invalid date

Delete or edit existing birthday.... long press on record..

On cancel - it should return back and update the main page.

when pressed back should update the main page.

Can notify few days before.... so we can add settings for that as well..

Call directly from notification

A good UI.. for main page...

Give proper toasts when user doesn't do it as it has to be like didn't enter the date or name but still add pressed

When an app is installed first time there should not be need to restart the phone in order to start notifications..
