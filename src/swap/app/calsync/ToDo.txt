How to properly design your app
keeping things separate
Async architecture

First used service but then AlarmManager

To Do tasks-

Delete or edit existing birthday.... long press on record..

Can notify few days before.... so we can add settings for that as well..

Call directly from notification

A good UI.. for main page...

When an app is installed first time there should not be need to restart the phone in order to start notifications..
